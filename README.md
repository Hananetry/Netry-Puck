Netry Puck

Netry Puck is an action maze video game made in Python!
The player controls the main character, Netry, through an enclosed maze.
The objective of the game is to eat all the dots while avoiding four ghosts.
This is a small recreation of Pac-Man with only one level.
I made it as a school project to learn how to use classes. 
I'm uploading this game for you to use however you want.
